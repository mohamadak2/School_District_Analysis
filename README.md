# School_District_Analysis.

### Overview of the school district analysis

The objective of the assignment was to review the idea that the 9th graders grades were altered. This means that we need to compare two analysis.
- one with the 9th graders included
- one without the 9th graders included

This way we would be able to confirm how the grades may change with/without the 9th graders.

## Results:
### How is the district summary affected?

The data shows that the following slightly decreased without including the 9th graders:
- Average Math Score
- % Passing Math
- % Passing Reading
- % Overall Passing

However the following column remained the same:

- Average Reading Score

### How is the school summary affected?

The data shows that the following significantly decreased without including the 9th graders:

- % Passing Math
- % Overall Passing

However the following column remained relatively the same:

- Average Math Score
- % Passing Reading
- Average Reading Score


How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

The Overall passing score dramatically decreased from 90.94801% to 65.076453%. This means that removing the 9th graders drastically changed the data.

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
#### Math and reading scores by grade

There were very little differences between the two analysis.

#### Scores by school spending

Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

The data shows that the following slightly decreased without including the 9th graders:
- Average Math Score
- % Passing Math
- % Passing Reading
- % Overall Passing

However the following column remained the same:

- Average Reading Score

On a school level I saw the following:
The data shows that the following significantly decreased without including the 9th graders:

- % Passing Math
- % Overall Passing

However the following column remained relatively the same:

- Average Math Score
- % Passing Reading
- Average Reading Score

Overall I believe that the removing the 9th graders significantly lowered % Passing Math & % Overall Passing scores on a school level.
