# School_District_Analysis.

## Overview of the school district analysis

The objective of the assignment was to review the idea that the 9th graders grades were altered. This means that we need to compare two analysis.
- one with the 9th graders included
- one without the 9th graders included

This way we would be able to confirm how the grades may change with/without the 9th graders.
